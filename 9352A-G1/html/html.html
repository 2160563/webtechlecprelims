                        HTML (Hypertext MarkUp Language) is a devised language of computer that makes a website. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                       Those websites can be seen or viewed by anyone in this world that are connected in the Internet.

                    <li> 
                        HTML is easy to learn, with basics which people are accessible. It is also very powerful for what 
                        it may or can create.

                        HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language) has already been 7 years in existence. 
                        It has been evolved from being a very simple language into from being a very complex language, 
                        which makes web developers make a very interesting and different web pages with many tricks like
                        animated images and sounds.

                        <strong>HTML 1.0</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li> It was the first HTML that was released in the whole world. 
                                 Only few people around the world are involved in the web creation
                                 at that time, ant it is very limited too. There is nothing much to 
                                 be done with it. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>HTML 2.0</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It includes all features of the HTML 1.0 but added some on it to be mixed.
                                It became the standard for designing a website in 1997 January and has defined 
                                many of the HTML features for the very first time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>HTML 3.0</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML is becoming more popular and because of that more and more people are now using it.     But a trouble is started.
                                <strong>The Netscape Company</strong> was the  leader of of the web market at that time, with their <strong>Netscape Navigator</strong>. To answer 
                                the please of many of the HTML authors, they have developed the proprietery tags and attributes into their Netscape
                                Navigator, and it was called <strong>Netscape Navigation Tags.</strong>
                            </li>
                        
                            <li>This became a big problem because other browsers have tried to replicate those tags for       them not to be left behind.
                                This means that if you have designed a webpage using  the Netscape, the page will not be good in other browsers. This
                                becomes a confusion to others.  
                            </li>
                     
                            <li>At this time, Dave Ragget, intoduced a new draft of HTML, which is the HTML 3.0. It           includes many new features of 
                                the HTML, and he promised that this will be more powerful than the previous ones. But the browsers are very slow in
                                adapting these new features, and adding only few and nevermind the rest.
                            </li>
                        
                            <li>But the authors noted that there will always be improvements in the future because it is     designed to be a modular.  
                                This only means that it will be easier for many other companies to add in stages. 
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>HTML 3.2</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>The tags of some specific browsers came. It became a need that is to be found.  <strong>     <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank"> The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) </a>       </strong> was created in 1994 to keep the language on evolving. This work was named           <strong>WILBUR </strong> and later become known as HTML 3.2. 
                                Most of the extension tags had been introduced by the Netscape.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>HTML 4.01</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li> HTML 4.01 was a very large evolution of the standards of the HTML.  It has a code named      <strong>COUGAR.</strong>  Most of its functuons
                                and features came from the HTML 3.0, as well as the old tags and the CSS or the <strong>Cascading StyleSheet.</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li> W3C recommended this in 1997 December and become the offical standard in 1998, April.        Modern browsers also have a very good improvement. 
                            </li>
                            <li>While HTML 4.01 was out in a little while , the documentation have been revised and been     corrected on some of its features. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <strong> XHTML 1.0 </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At the 21st Century the W3C has issued the XHTML specification. Since 2000, January 26,       it became the standard with the 
                                HTML 4.01 have their new specifications to work. It is a new branch for the HTML that incorporates the HTML. There aren't 
                                many new tags and attributes ib the XHTML but other things have changed which makes it more accessible and functional. 
                                It is a new set of coding rules.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong> HTML 5 </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It was in this time that many of pragmatic web technology fans,  programmers and             specification writers started to build
                                their own language, and not using the W3C procedures.  They were called the <strong>WHATG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Group)</strong>
                                and developed a new specification.
                            </li>
                            <li>HTML 5 is designed for the web, today, tomorrow and in the future. It is the spec that       will be still working in at least a few more decades so it's development is very slow and     is considered.

                    <li> 
                        Html, like any other computer language, consists of a series of code. These codes are called html elements. The code is then saved onto an html file which will be then viewed by a browser like chrome or firefox. The browser translates or compiles the code into its visible form.

                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        Tags are the basic building block of an html document. They are the ones surrounded by the angle-brackets. Tags can’t be seen on the rendered page but their effects are.
                        They are basically the ones responsible for manipulating the data the user has entered.
                        Tags are basically structured as:
                        <strong> &lt;tag&gt; content &lt;/tag&gt; </strong>
                    </li>

                    <li> 
                        <strong> The opening tag</strong>
                        - this is made up of the name of the element surrounded by angle-brackets. This states where the element shall begin.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong> The closing tag</strong>
                        - same as the opening tag with regards to structure but it instead specifies the end of the element.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong> The content</strong>
                        - this can be considered as the data being manipulated by html tags. Most often than not, they are encased within the tags.
