            <h2>Cascading Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>Most of the web pages and web applications that we can accessed via Internet are made from HTML. Yes, we are able to decorate web pages with colors, font styles, background image, hyperlinks and much more BUT it is totally limited, also it makes HTML documents difficult to read and maintain. So, to make it easier to give layout to web pages, style sheets are used. The widely used style sheet is Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
                
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation of HTML or XHTML documents. Along with the HTML and JavaScript, CSS is used to websites to create layout and style for web pages, and user interfaces for web applications as well as for mobile applications.</p>
                
            <p>For a diminutive outlook about the history of CSS, the first draft of CSS was proposed by Hakon Wium Lie, who worked with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, in October 1994. Bert Bos, who responded to the first draft of CSS and was building Argo web browser at that time, decided to join forces with Lie.</p>
                
            <p>HTML and CSS are the core basis for building web pages and web applications. HTML provides the structure of the pages, while CSS provides the presentation or layout of the pages. The primary advantage of CSS is that it allows the separation of the content of HTML documents from the presentational aspect of the document. The separation of the stylesheet from the HTML makes it easier to maintain web pages and applications, and cascades by means of enabling to share and use one stylesheet across multiple web documents.</p>

            <h3>Three Types of CSS</h3>
                
            <ol class = "main-list">
                <li>External style sheets</li>
                <p>The CSS instructions in this type of style sheet are within a separated file with .css file extension. It is the most used type of CSS, since it is accessible and can be applied to multiple web documents. External style sheets are defined using the link tag and places within the head section of a web document. </p>
                    
                <li>Internal style sheets </li>
                <p>These style sheets are placed on top of each web document. If you want to have a unique style for a particular web document, it is the recommended type of CSS. It is defined using the style tag, where the CSS instructions located, and goes within the head section.</p>
                    
                <li>Inline style sheets </li>
                <p>If you want to apply a single style of an element, inline style sheet is used. It is declared with the style attribute within a particular element and affects that element only. </p>                        
            </ol>

            <h3>Style sheets by priority</h3>
            <p>As stated before, it is possible to have a use multiple style sheets on a web document. For example, an external stylesheet and inline style sheet are used on one page. The question is, if a property that has been set for the same tag in different style sheet on a same page, what definition of property will be used? Of course, the style sheet that has the highest priority. Letâ€™s based the priority level on the given diagram below:</p>
