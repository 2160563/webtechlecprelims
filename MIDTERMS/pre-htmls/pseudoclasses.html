            <h2>CSS Pseudo Classes</h2>
            <p>A <span class = "highlight-text">pseudo-class</span> is a keyword that included in a selector that defines a special state of the selected element(s). With the help of pseudo-classes, you do not need to use JavaScript to add effects to some selectors. For example, if you want to change a navigation tab’s color when user hovers over it, use the :hover pseudo-class. </p>
            
            <h3>Syntax</h3>
            <p>Here is a simple valid syntax of pseudo-classes:</p>
            <pre>
            selector: pseudo-class {
	           property: value;
            }
            </pre>
            
            <p>If a CSS class is used with pseudo-classes, the syntax is as follows:</p>
            <pre>
            selector.classname:pseudo-class {
	           property: value
            }
            </pre>
