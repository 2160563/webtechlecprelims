            <h2>CSS Declarations</h2>
            <p>A <span class="hightlight-text">CSS declaration</span> sets CSS properties to identified values is the core function of the CSS language and any CSS engine calculates which declarations are able to apply in every single element of a page in order to appropriately style it and lay it out.</p>
            <ul class = "main-list">
                <li>Properties</li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Shorthand Properties</li>
                    <p>These properties allow authors to specify the values of several properties with a single property.</p>
                    <h6>Examples: </h6>
                    <pre>background, font, margin, padding, border</pre>
                    
                    <li>Vendor Specific Extensions (also known as <strong>vendor prefixes</strong>)</li>
                    <p>Used by browser vendors as a prefix for the names of experimental or non-standard CSS properties; lately, vendors are moving away from vendor prefixes in favor of user-controlled flags or preferences</p>
                    <h6>Examples:</h6>
                    <pre>-webkit, -moz, -o, -ms</pre>
                    
                    <li>Custom Properties, also known as <strong>CSS variable</strong> (experimental)</li>
                    <p>Property names prefixed with --, representing a value that can be reused throughout the document using the var() function.</p>                    
                </ul>
                
                <li>Values</li>
                <p>declared, cascaded, specified, computed, used, actual values</p>
                
                <li>Value Types</li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Keywords</li>
                    <p>A <span class="highight-text">CSS keyword</span> is a pre-defined value that can be used as the value of a CSS property.</p>
                    <h4 class = "sub-topic">CSS-Wide Keywords</h4>
                    <p>Here are the keywords that can be used for any CSS property value:</p>
                    <pre>inherit</pre>
                    <p>This keyword copies the value of the property in effect from the parent of the element.</p>
                    <pre>initial</pre>
                    <p>This keyword represents the default value of the property.</p>
                    <pre>unset</pre>
                    <p>This keyword is same as the inherit keyword. It allows a property to adapts the inherited value from the parent element, otherwise set to initial value if there is no parent at all.</p>
                    
                    <li>Numbers</li>
                    <p>These are simply integers or reals in (scientific) decimal notation.</p>
                    
                    <li>Dimensions</li>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li>Length Units</li>
                        <ul class = "sub-sublist">
                            <li>Font-relative</li>
                            <pre>em, ex, ch, rem</pre>

                        <li>Angle Units</li>
                        <p>These units are used in <strong>gradient</strong> and <strong>transform</strong> functions.</p>
                        <pre>deg, grad, rad, turn</pre>
                        
                        <li>Duration</li>

                        <li>Frequency Units</li>
                        <p>These values are denoted by &lt;frequency&gt;, and are used with aural CSS like the pitch of a speaking voice. It initially introduced in CSS2 for the (obsoleted) aural media types; reintroduced in CSS3, but is currently unused</p>
                        <pre>Hz, kHz</pre>
                        
                        <li>Resolution Units</li>
                        <p>These values are used in media queries.</p>
                        <pre>dpi, dpcm, dppx</pre>
                        
                        <li>Percentages</li>
                        <p>These are numbers with a percent sign (%) suffix. Calculated as a percentage of some value (usually taken from the parent element).</p>
                        
                        <li>URLs and URIs</li>
                        <p>These are <strong>url()</strong> function with an absolute or relative (to the stylesheet) URL parameter. It demotes a pointer to a resource, such as an image or a font.</p>
                        
                        <li>Colors</li>
                        <ul class="sub-sublist">
                            <li>Basic Color Keywords</li>
                            <p>These are simply the colors names, which are case-insensitive.</p>
                            <pre>aqua, blue, green, red, silver, gray</pre>
                            
                            <li>RGB/RGBA hexadecimal notation: #RGB[A]</li>
                            <p><strong>R (red), G (green), B (blue), and A (alpha)</strong> are hexadecimal characters (from 0 up to 9, and from A up to F). A (alpha) is optional. The three-digit notation (#RGB) is a shorter version of the six-digit form (#RRGGBB), and the four-igit notation is a shorter version of the eight-digit for (#RRGGBBAA). </p>
                            <pre>#ffffff, #000000, #cdcdcd, #0000ff </pre>
                            
                            <li>RGB/RGBA Function: rgb[R, G, B] or rgb[R, G, B, A]</li>
                            <p>The R, G, and A can be either integers or percentage, where the 255 value is equivalent to 100%. Since alpha (A) corresponds to transparency and opacity, the accepted value ranges between 0 and 1 or 0% to 100%, where 1 is equivalent to 100% opacity and 0 for transparency.</p>
                            <pre>rgb(255,0,153), rgb(255, 0, 153, 1)</pre>
                            
                            <li>HSL Function: hsl[H, S, L] or hsl[H, S, L, A] or hsla[H, S, L, A]</li>
                            <p>Using this function, a color can be defined according to its hue, saturation and lightness using the hsl() and hsla functions. </p>
                            <p>Hue (H) is an angle of the color circle, so it means that the value in H is in number or integer. </p>
                            <p>Saturation (s) and Lightness (L) are percentages, where 100% leads to completely saturation and white for lightness.</p>
                            <p>Alpha (A) is always optional. It can be a number between 0 and 1 or 0% to 100%, where the number 0 is equivalent to 100% transparency.</p>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Functions</li>
                        <p>Used as a value for various CSS properties</p>
