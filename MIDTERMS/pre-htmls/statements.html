            <h2>CSS Statements</h2>
            <p><span class = "highlight-text">Statements</span> are building blocks that begin with non-space characters and end with a semi-colon or first enclosing curly brace. There are two types of statements:</p>
                
            <ol class ="main-list">
                <li>CSS At-rules</li>
                <p>An <span class = "highlight-text">At-rule statement</span> starts with an at sign (<strong>@</strong>), and then followed by an identifier. Each type of at-rules may have its own internal syntax and semantics. These statements are used to convey conditional information, descriptive information and meta-data information. Here are some of examples of at-rules used in CSS:</p>
                <ul class = "sub-list">
                    <li>@charset</li>
                    <li>@import</li>
                    <li>@namespace</li>
                    <li>@document</li>
                    <li>@font-face</li>
                    <Li>@keyframes</Li>
                    <li>@media</li>
                    <li>@page</li>
                    <li>supports</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <li>CSS Rule-sets</li>
                <p><span class = "highlight-text">CSS Rule-sets</span> consists of selector(s) followed by an enclosed declaration block, which contains one or more declarations. Each declaration must end with semi-colon, otherwise the declarations will not be applied except the first declaration. </p>
            </ol>
