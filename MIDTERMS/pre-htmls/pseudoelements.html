            <h2>CSS Pseudo Elements</h2>
            <p>A <span class = "highlight-text">pseudo element</span> is used to style specified parts of an element. In addition, it is also a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected elements.</p>
            <p>Here is the list of pseudo elements:</p>
            <pre>::after </pre>
            <p>This element is used to insert something after the content of an element.</p>
            <pre>::before</pre>
            <p>This element is used to insert something before the content of an element.</p>
            <pre>::selection </pre>
            <p>This element is used to select a portion of an element that is selected by a user.</p>
            <pre>:first-letter, ::first-letter</pre>
            <p>These two are used to add a special style to the first letter of a text.</p>
            <pre>:first-line, ::first-line</pre>
            <p>These two are used to add a special style to the first line of a text.</p>
            
            <p>Note: The single colon was used when it was still CSS1 and CSS2, then replaced the single colon to double colon when it is already CSS3.</p>
