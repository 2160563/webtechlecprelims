            <h1>HTTP</h1>
            <p>HTTP is based on a client-server architecture.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Servers - origin server</li>
                <li>Clients also know as (User Agents) - web browsers, web crawlers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, a communication protocol used to access resources on the World Wide Web. Invented by Tim-Berners Lee at CERN in 1989.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>HTTP with its Version History:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTP 0.9 (1991)</li>
                <li>HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, May 1996) - GET, HEADER, POST</li>
                <li>HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 Jan 1997; RFC 2616 June 1999), RFC 7230 - 7235(June 2014)</li>
                <li>HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015) - additional mechanism in the transmission of data with header compression that allows multi pleasing which is more enhanced than the previous versions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <p>HTTP uses a request message. In addition, it is a stateless communications protocol. We have here its functionalities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cache Control</li>
                <li>Content Media Type (MIME)</li>
                <li>Persistent Connection - it can be reuse</li>
                <li>Request Pipelining/Multiplexing - can have many request at a time.</li>
                <li>Authentication/Authorization - talks about the security and identifies if the client can be verified and authorized at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>HTTP Resource Addressing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheme(http or https)</li>
                <li>Authority - domain name(resolved to an IP address DNS), host, post number and user information or authentication credentials.</li>
                <li>Path to resource(to resolve relative to the document on the server).</li>
                <li>Query - set of key = value pairs use: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>(&)Ampersand</li>
                        <li>(?)Delimeter</li>
                        <li>(>)URL - encoded</li>
                    </ul>	
                </li>
                <li>Fragment identifier - subsection</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>First: Request line:</h4>
            <p>Method - Target - HTTP Protocol</p>

            <h3>Response Message:</h3>
            <h4>First: status line</h4>
            <p>Protocol - status code - status(reason phrase)</p>

            <h3>Message Header</h3>
            <p>3 types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>General - relate to the characteristics itself</li>
                <li>Entity - characteristics of the body</li>
                <li>Response</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Demonstration of Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Content negatiation - an HTTP client</li>
                <li>Point of negatiation - accept, decept-encoding</li>
                <li>MIME Type
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plain/HTML</li>
                        <li>Value/Value - text, application - dependent, audio, image, video</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>ACCEPT</h3>
            <p>The value of accept is what will be rendered.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>ACCEPT-ENCODING</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fetch compressed format</li>
                <li>Ones received it will automatically uncompressed/deflate the date</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*note - without the ACCEPT-ENCODING it will fetch the uncompressed data</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>RANGE-REQUEST</h3>
            <p>Perform partial content/resource retrieval using:</p>
            <h3>ACCEPT-RANGES/RANGE HEADER</h3>
            <p>If range not satisfiable, there's an error</p>
            <h3>AUTHORIZATION/AUTHENTICATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>WebDAV can enable in WAMP, Apache modules</li>
                <li>when you copy it also includes the DESTINATION</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*note - without the ACCEPT-ENCODING it will fetch the uncompressed data</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>STANDARD METHOD</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>GET - fetch or simply select requiremen to all servers.</li>
                <li>HEAD - retreive only metadata possibly to validate data</li>
                <li>POST - perform resource, specific processing. In addition, if there is a post, there is a message body and is mostly used in submitting HTML from data.</li>
                <li>PUT - hard to implement</li>
                <li>DELETE - hard to implement</li>
                <li>OPTIONS - tells what you can do</li>
                <li>TRACE - allows the server to re-echo the request</li>
                <li>CONNECT - create a secure connection and establish a tunnel.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>SAFE METHOD</h2>
            <p>Like read only, no expected change just simply fetching</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Idempotent Methods</h3>
            <p>Intended effect on the server of multiple identical request.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cacheable Methods</h3>
            <p>Indicates that the response to a method is allowed to be stored for future use. In addition, it also saves on a bandwidth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GET, HEAD, POST</li>
            </ul>
