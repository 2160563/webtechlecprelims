                    <li>  
                        Is a protocol that mainly turns a user-friendly domain name like <b> webtek.org </b> (as from the example above) to an IP address that computers use to connect to each other via the network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the help of the DNS we don't have to memorize every IP address of every website that we visit. Instead, we just need to connect through a <strong> domain name server </strong> which maps the domain names to their IP addresses.
